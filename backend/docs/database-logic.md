# Database Logic

In this we translate the logic of the database fields and add details that we should know


## Tree
A tree has no respective table, but it is a collection of checkouts with the same `git_commit_hash` and `patchset_hash`, but pretty much nobody uses `patchset_hash` nowadays, so it will probably be `null` in most cases

> **Note:** There is an already in use Grafana dashboard that we can use to extract the logic

## Checkouts table
Checkouts consist when a CI check to a git branch and perform a build and its tests
A tree will have multiple checkouts, so they can have multiple builds


## Builds table
The builds that a checkout has performed.


## Test table

Tests are linked to a build

Important thing to look at the tests table is the `path` column, which is the type of test that it is performing.
They will be split in dots, which means that is a child test from that test. `eg: boot.start` is a child of `boot`

- `start_time` is the time that a test has started, we can use that to graph X-Axis graphs of tests over time
 
- `status` Column show a status that can be `PASS` `SKIP` or `ERROR` 

It is important to notice that the `misc` field will show the error message in case of an error

eg:
```
{
  "arch": "arm64",
  "compiler": "gcc-12",
  "error_msg": "Invalid TESTCASE signal",
  "error_code": "Test",
  "kernel_type": "image"
}
```

- `environtment_misc` a JSON field that we can use for things about the environment like detecting the platform, this is not set in stone and can change,  so we should double check the validation

```
{
  "job_id": "14750408",
  "platform": "hp-x360-14a-cb0001xx-zork"
}
```
