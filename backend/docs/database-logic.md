# Database Logic

In this we translate the logic of the database fields and add details
that we should know


There are some resources that can be used as reference:
- [Grafana Dashboard](https://kcidb.kernelci.org/d/home/home?orgId=1&refresh=30m)
- [Submitter guide](https://docs.kernelci.org/kcidb/submitter_guide/)
- [kcidb json schema](https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb-io/blob/main/kcidb_io/schema/v04_03.py)

## Tree

A tree is a set of repos and branches, normally just one pair,
but more are possible. Essentially, a tree is a copy of the code base maintained
separately for a particular purpose.

Maestro maintains its own database of trees, where each is given a
name (`Checkouts.tree_name`), those names are generally
accepted and often recognized, but were chosen by
Maestro (KernelCI Legacy before it) developers and maintainers over a
period of time, and are not standardized, other CI systems are free
to report whatever they want there. Most choose not to report anything
in that field.

## Checkouts table

A checkout is a record of a CI system checking out a particular revision from
a particular git repository and branch. The json schema also says that checkouts
"represents the way the tested source code was obtained and its original
location. E.g. checking out a particular commit from a git repo, and applying
a set of patches on top."

## Test table

Tests are linked to a build

Important thing to look at the tests table is the `path` column, which is the
type of test that it is performing. They will be split by dots, which means that
it is a child test from that test. `eg: boot.start` is a child of `boot`

- `start_time` is the time that a test has started, we can use that to graph
 X-Axis graphs of tests over time
 
- `status` column show a status that can be `PASS` `SKIP` or `ERROR`

- `misc` a JSON field that is used to store miscellaneous data about the test like
archicture, compiler, runtime, kernel type, etc. However, it does not have a fixed
structure, and therefore can contain any type of information the CI system finds
useful to store. It's possible to note this phenomenon when comparing the misc field
between origins. The `misc` field might have data related to errors, but's generally
not used since it's unreliable

example of a typical `misc` field of Maestro:
```json
{
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "runtime": "lava-collabora",
  "compiler": "gcc-12",
  "kernel_type": "bzimage"
}
```

- `environment_misc` a JSON field that we can use for things about the environment
like detecting the platform, this is not set in stone and can change,
so we should double check the validation. On Maestro it's expected that `platform` should
be a field inside the `environment_misc` JSON.

```json
{
  "job_id": "14750408",
  "platform": "hp-x360-14a-cb0001xx-zork"
}
```

>NOTE: The contents of the columns `misc` and `environment_misc` are not standardized, and
>shouldn't be relied upon to ever be used consistently by more than one
>CI system ("origin"), or even by the originating CI system itself, over time.
>The most it could be used for is a proof-of-concept.

- `environment_compatible` contains a sorted list of strings starting with the exact
name of the machine, followed by an optional list of boards it is compatible with sorted
from most compatible to least.

>NOTE: The concept of "Hardware" used througout the dashboard also includes
>the `platform` found in the `environment_misc` column. Up to this point, the rule is
>to prioritize `platform` over `environment_compatible` since, at least on Maestro,
>`platform` provides a more informative representation of the hardware used during the
>test/boot/build. This, however, does not apply to the Hardware Listing and Details pages
> that still prioritize the `environment_compatible` over `platform`
>

>be used as a reference:

- `output_files` is a JSON field that has an array of objects, each of them having data about
the artifacts generated by the test. The Builds table also has an `input_files` column that respects
the same structure

```json
[
   {
      "url":"https://storage.kernelci.org/broonie-sound/for-next/v6.11-rc3-218-gc76d5dfbfc97/arm64/defconfig/gcc-12/lab-broonie/lava-meson-sm1-s905d3-libretech-cc.json",
      "name":"lava_json"
   },

      "name":"txt"
   },
   {

      "name":"html"
   }
]
```


## Revision

Revision has no respective table, but it is a collection of checkouts with
the same `git_commit_hash` and `patchset_hash`. But `patchset_hash` is not commonly used these days.
